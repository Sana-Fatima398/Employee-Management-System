Case Study: Employee Management System 

Objective: 
      Develop a simple Employee Management System using an N-tier architecture with a console application and file 
      Systems for data storage. The system should allow adding, updating, deleting, and searching for employees while 
      ensuring data integrity. The system will utilize a 3-tier architecture consisting of: 

      1. Presentation Tier (Console Application): 
        -> Handles user interaction and displays information in a structured manner. 
      2. Business Logic Layer (Class Library): 
        -> Implements core functionalities, validation rules, and interactions with the Data Access Layer and apply business logic 
      3. Data Access Layer (Class Library): 
          -> Manages CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using files 

Technologies: 
• C# 
• .NET 
• File Handling for Storage 
 
 
Tasks & Requirements: 
    1. Data Storage Setup: 
        • Use files as the database alternative  
        • Defining the following entities and storing them in separate files:  Employees.txt (Stores Employee Data), Departments.txt (Stores Department Details) 
    2. Data Access Layer (DAL) - File Operations: 
        • Create a class library project named EmployeeManagementDAL 
        • Implemented CRUD operations for employees and departments 
    3. Business Logic Layer (BLL) - Core Functionalities: 
        • Create a class library project named EmployeeManagementBLL 
        • Implemented core business logic 
    4. Presentation Tier (Console Application) - UI & User Interaction: 
        • user-friendly menu 
 
Deliverables: 
    Well-structured solution with N-Tier separation 
    Clear documentation and code comments 
    File Systems for storage
